The diversity of Sinitic variants is comparable to the Romance languages.\\n\\nFrom a purely descriptive point of view, \"languages\" and \"dialects\" are simply arbitrary groups of similar idiolects, and the distinction is irrelevant to linguists who are only concerned with describing regional speeches technically. However, the idea of a single language has major overtones in politics and cultural self-identity, and explains the amount of emotion over this issue. Most Chinese  and Chinese linguists  refer to Chinese as a single language and its subdivisions dialects, while others  call Chinese a language family.', 'The spoken language has mostly developed naturally from earlier forms of Finnish, and spread from main cultural and political centres. The standard language, however, has always been a consciously constructed medium for literature. It preserves grammatical patterns that have mostly vanished from the colloquial varieties and, as its main application is writing, it features complex syntactic patterns that are not easy to handle when used in speech. The spoken language develops significantly faster, and the grammatical and phonological simplifications include also the most common pronouns and suffixes, which sum up to frequent but modest differences. Some sound changes have been left out of the formal language, such as the irregularization of some common verbs by assimilation, e.g. tule- → tuu- (although tule can be used in spoken language as well).\\n\\nWritten language certainly still exerts a considerable influence upon the spoken word, due to the fact that illiteracy is nonexistent and many Finns are avid readers. In fact, it is still not entirely uncommon to meet people who \"talk like a book\" (puhuvat kirjakieltä), although this is seen as pedantic. More common is the intrusion of typically book-like constructions into a colloquial discourse, as a kind of quote from written Finnish. It should also be noted that it is quite common to hear book-like and polished speech on radio or TV, and the constant exposure to such language tends to lead to the adoption of such constructions even in everyday language.', 'At the same time, the language has become more analytic, and has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect.\\n\\nThe English vocabulary has changed considerably over the centuries. For the processes and triggers of English vocabulary changes cf. English and General Historical Lexicology (by Joachim Grzega and Marion Schöner)\\n\\nLike many languages deriving from Proto-Indo-European (PIE), many of the most common words in English can trace back their origin (through the Germanic branch) to PIE. Such words include the basic pronouns I, from Old English ic, (cf. Latin ego, Greek ego, Sanskrit aham), me (cf. Latin me, Greek eme, Sanskrit mam), numbers (e.g. one, two, three, cf. Latin unus, duo, tres, Greek oinos \"ace (on dice)\", duo, treis), common family relationships such as mother, father, brother, sister etc (cf. Greek \"meter\", Latin \"mater\", Sanskrit \"matṛ\"; mother), names of many animals (cf. Sankrit mus, Greek mys, Latin mus; mouse), and many common verbs (cf. Greek gignōmi, Latin gnoscere, Hittite kanes; to know).\\n\\nGermanic words (generally words of Old English or to a lesser extent Norse origin) tend to be shorter than the Latinate words of English and more common in ordinary speech. This includes nearly all the basic pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, modal verbs etc. that form the basis of English syntax and grammar. The longer Latinate words are often regarded as more elegant or educated. However, the excessive use of Latinate words is considered at times to be either pretentious or an attempt to obfuscate an issue. George Orwell\\'s essay \"Politics and the English Language\", considered an important scrutinization of the English language, is critical of this, as well as other perceived misuse of the language.']], 'uris': None, 'data': None}\n",

The diversity of Sinitic variants is comparable to the Romance languages.\\n\\nFrom a purely descriptive point of view, \"languages\" and \"dialects\" are simply arbitrary groups of similar idiolects, and the distinction is irrelevant to linguists who are only concerned with describing regional speeches technically. However, the idea of a single language has major overtones in politics and cultural self-identity, and explains the amount of emotion over this issue. Most Chinese  and Chinese linguists  refer to Chinese as a single language and its subdivisions dialects, while others  call Chinese a language family.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe spoken language has mostly developed naturally from earlier forms of Finnish, and spread from main cultural and political centres. The standard language, however, has always been a consciously constructed medium for literature. It preserves grammatical patterns that have mostly vanished from the colloquial varieties and, as its main application is writing, it features complex syntactic patterns that are not easy to handle when used in speech. The spoken language develops significantly faster, and the grammatical and phonological simplifications include also the most common pronouns and suffixes, which sum up to frequent but modest differences.

      "Yes, the semantics of a language can cause false friends to exist. A false friend is a word or phrase that has two meanings within a language, but is often used to convey a different meaning or connotation. For example, \"fake\" and \"truth\" are two different words in English, but they have the same meaning in Finnish. This is because the word \"fake\" has a different meaning in English than it does in Finnish, and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The semantics of a language can also cause false friends to exist due to the way a language is used in conversation. For example, the word \"beer\" can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. If the context is in a social situation, the word \"beer\" might be used to mean alcohol, whereas in a more formal context it might be used to mean a beverage. This can lead to the false friends \"beer\" and \"beverage\" being used interchangeably, even though they have different meanings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to semantics, linguists also consider the cultural context in which a language is spoken to determine the meaning of words and phrases. For example, if a language is spoken\n"

      "Retrieved from doc: {'S08_set3_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: Adam's opposition to Hamilton was primarily due to their differing political beliefs and personalities. Hamilton was a Federalist, while Adams was a Democratic-Republican. Hamilton was more outspoken and opinionated, while Adams was more reserved and considered. Their political differences were rooted in their differing views on the nature of government and the role of the presidency. Hamilton advocated for a strong central government with strong executive powers, while Adams supported a more decentralized system with a strong executive and judiciary branch. Hamilton's advocacy for a strong central government, which he believed was necessary for the protection of individual rights and the preservation of the nation's unity, was a major source of friction between Adams and Hamilton. They often clashed over issues such as the national debt, tariffs, and the Federalist Party's platform, which emphasized the importance of a strong national government. In addition, Hamilton's views on the role of the presidency were controversial, and some Federalists believed that he was too authoritarian and too willing to ignore the will of the people.

      "Answer: Kangaroos use \"crawl-walking\" to move at slow speeds in search of food and water, rather than the more efficient \"hopping\" method. During this slow movement, they use their tail to form a tripod with their two forelimbs. They then raise their hind feet forward, in a form of locomotion called \"crawl-walking.\" The tail is used to form a \"hopper\" shape, allowing the kangaroo to move forward while keeping its weight distributed evenly across its hind feet.\n",

      "Answer: Yes, it is true that semantics causes a number of false friends. A false friend is a term that is used to describe a word that is used in a way that is not intended. The meaning of a word can change over time, and the meaning of a word can be different from the meaning it has when it is first used. This phenomenon is known as semantic change, and it is one of the key features of language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Semantic change occurs when a word is used in a way that is not intended by the speaker or writer. For example, a person may say \"I love my dog\" and it might be understood as a statement of fact, but it can also be understood as a request for help. As a result, the meaning of the word \"dog\" can be different from the meaning it had when it was first used.\n",

      "Answer: Yes, local variations in the formal written version of the language are quite limited, with very few spellings and grammar differences between British and American English.

      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: Bartolomeo Cristofori did not invent the modern piano. Cristofori was an early instrumentalist who invented the basic mechanical and technological principles of the piano, but it was not until a few years later, during the early 18th century, that a significant number of piano builders began to work on creating instruments with different features and functionalities. \n",

      "Gottfried Silbermann, a German organ builder, was a notable early inventor of the modern piano, and he was the first to incorporate the forerunner of the modern damper pedal into his pianos, which is still used today. Silbermann's innovative approach to piano design and his foresight in building instruments with different features and functionalities helped to revolutionize the piano industry and pave the way for the development of new types of piano, such as the harpsichord, the clavichord, and the pianoforte.\n",
      "Question: What is the middle pedal called on grand pianos?\n",
      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: The middle pedal on a grand piano is called the \"practice\" pedal, also known as the \"celeste\" pedal or the \"bass sustain\" pedal. It is a sostenuto pedal that drops a piece of felt between the hammers and strings, and greatly muting the sounds. The \"practice\" pedal is often used when a pianist needs to sustain a single bass note or chord over many measures, while playing the melody in the treble section. The \"celeste\" pedal and the \"bass sustain\" pedal are non-standard variants of the middle pedal on grand pianos.\n",

      "Answer: Modern pianos have a total of 36 black keys, which is 7 less than the 52 white keys of a grand piano.\n",
      "Question: What is the sustain pedal called?\n",
      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: The sustain pedal is a pedal on a grand piano that is used to sustain a sound while the player's hands are free to play other notes. It is a sostenuto pedal, which means that it keeps a raised damper while the player's hands are free to play other notes. The sustain pedal is not the same as the soft pedal, which is a pedal that moves the hammers closer to the strings to produce a soft, muted sound. The sustain pedal is often found on the pedals of pianos that have a large number of keys, such as those used in concert halls or large public concerts.\n",

      "Answer: Irving Berlin played a special piano called the transposing piano, which was invented in 1801 by Edward Ryley. It had a lever under the keyboard used to alter the music to any key. One of Berlin's pianos is in the Smithsonian Museum.\n",
      "Question: Is the left-most pedal on a grand piano called the una corda?\n",
      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: Yes, the left-most pedal on a grand piano is called the \"una corda\" pedal. It is a variation of the \"soft pedal\" and is used to change the overall tone of the piano. The una corda pedal is a more powerful and precise way to adjust the volume and tone of a grand piano compared to the soft pedal.\n",
      "Question: Is it advantageous for a grand piano's metal plate to be quite massive?\n",
      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: Yes, the metal plate of a grand piano is usually quite massive. This is because grand pianos are often played by musicians who require a large, powerful, and efficient sound system. The size and weight of the metal plate are crucial for supporting the weight of the strings and amplifiers that are used in playing grand pianos. The use of large, heavy metal plates in grand pianos helps to amplify the sound and create a powerful, rich, and resonant sound. This is important for the musician's performance, as it allows them to produce complex and expressive sounds. The use of cast iron, which is less massive and weaker, would not be practical or effective for the production of a grand piano.\n",
      "Question: Is the mechanism in an upright piano perpendicular to its keys?\n",
      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: No, the mechanism in an upright piano is not perpendicular to its keys. The keys are always parallel to the action, which is the mechanism that controls the hammer to string contact. The action is located on the front of the keyboard, which means that the keys are closest to the action and the hammer rests closest to the strings. This arrangement allows for greater control and accuracy in playing, but it also means that the action is higher up on the keyboard than in a studio piano or a console piano.\n",
      "Question: About how tall is a typical studio piano?\n",
      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: A typical studio piano is around 42 to 45 inches tall. However, the exact height can vary depending on the manufacturer and the specific model. The height of a studio piano is typically lower than the height of a standard upright piano. In some cases, the height of a studio piano may be slightly higher than a standard upright piano due to the additional height required for the piano's mechanism and the soundboard.\n",
      "Question: What are a piano's keys generally made of?\n",
      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: A piano's keys are generally made of spruce or basswood, for lightness. Spruce is normally used in high-quality pianos. Traditionally, the black keys were made from ebony and the white keys were covered with strips of ivory, but since ivory-yielding species are now endangered and protected by treaty, plastics are now almost exclusively used. Also, ivory tends to chip more easily than plastic. Legal ivory can still be obtained in limited quantities. At one time, the Yamaha firm innovated a plastic called \"Ivorine\" or \"Ivorite\", since imitated by other makers, that mimics the look and feel of ivory.\n",
      "Question: How many total keys does a typical modern piano have?\n",
      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: The typical modern piano has 36 black keys and 52 white keys for a total of 88 keys. However, some older pianos only have 85 keys (seven octaves from A0 to C8) while some manufacturers extend the range further in one or both directions. The extra keys are sometimes hidden under a small hinged lid that can be flipped down to cover the keys in order to avoid visual disorientation in a pianist unfamiliar with the extended keyboard. On some older models, the keys are hidden behind a small hinged lid that can be flipped down to expose the keys. The total number of keys on a piano depends on the manufacturer, model, and version, but generally, it ranges from 36 to 88.\n",
      "Question: Why are upright pianos more compact?\n",
      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: Upright pianos are more compact because they have a shorter height than their vertical counterparts. The height of a piano is determined by the dimensions of the piano's frame and the height of the top of the piano's keyboard. Upright pianos have a shorter height than studio pianos, which have a longer piano frame and higher top, making them easier to maneuver and store. Additionally, the shorter height of upright pianos allows for more space in the room for the player to move around. Therefore, the vertical action is more suitable for pianos with longer frames and higher tops, while upright pianos are more suitable for pianos with shorter frames and higher tops.\n",
      "Question: Do older pianos have more keys than modern pianos?\n",
      "Retrieved from doc: {'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}\n",
      "Answer: Yes, older pianos have more keys than modern pianos. The number of keys on a piano is generally greater because modern pianos have a smaller range than older pianos. Modern pianos typically have 88 keys, but older pianos have 68 or even fewer keys. This is because some older pianos only have 85 keys (seven octaves from A0 to A7), while some manufacturers extend the range further in one or both directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason why there are more keys on a modern piano is that the designers of the piano had to fit more keys onto a smaller space. In an earlier era, pianos had more keys, but that was because the size of the instrument required more keys to accommodate the limited space available. By contrast, modern pianos have a larger space to work with, and designers were able to fit more keys onto a smaller number of keys.\n",
