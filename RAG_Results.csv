2. Adjectives: In German, adjectives are often placed before the noun they modify, while in Swedish, they are usually placed after the noun.

3. Verb tenses: In German, the verb tenses are more complex than in Swedish, with the exception of the verb ""sein"" (to have), which always denotes past tense. In Swedish, the verb tenses are simpler and only denote past tense.

117,English_language,Is it true that semantics causes a number of false friends?,"Yes, it is true that semantics causes a number of false friends. A false friend is a term that is used to describe a word that is used in a way that is not intended. The meaning of a word can change over time, and the meaning of a word can be different from the meaning it has when it is first used. This phenomenon is known as semantic change, and it is one of the key features of language.

Semantic change occurs when a word is used in a way that is not intended by the speaker or writer. For example, a person may say ""I love my dog"" and it might be understood as a statement of fact, but it can also be understood as a request for help. As a result, the meaning of the word ""dog"" can be different from the meaning it had when it was first used.

Semantics can also cause false friends when a word is used in a way that is not intended by the speaker. For example, the word ""hypothesis"" is often used in scientific contexts to refer to a theory, but it can also be used to refer to a hypothesis, meaning an untestable or unsubstantiated theory.

154,Pablo_Picasso,"Are among his most famous works the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and Guernica (1937), his portrayal of the German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War?","Yes, among Picasso's most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and Guernica (1937). Both paintings depict the same figures on the left side of the canvas, but in a different style, with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon being more realistic and Guernica being more abstract. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon was created in the early 1900s, while Guernica was created during the Spanish Civil War. The similarities between these works suggest that Picasso's Cubist period was influenced by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War, as well as his interest in experimenting with different styles and ideas.",{'S10_set6_a1.txt.cl'},S10_set6_a1,1
155,Piano,Are pianos used in Western music?,"Yes, pianos are used extensively in Western music, both as an instrument and as a source of inspiration. In classical music, pianos are often used as a solo instrument to accompany the singer, to produce melodies and harmonies, and to create a sense of intimacy between the performer and the listener. 

In jazz, pianos are often used to play melodic and harmonic lines, creating a sense of swing and rhythm. In popular music, pianos are often used to create a sense of nostalgia and melancholy, often in ballads and acoustic songs.

In popular music, pianos are often used as a backdrop for vocal harmonies and arrangements. In rock music, pianos are often used to create a sense of emotion and depth, often by creating a sense of space and reverberation in the sound.

Overall, pianos have been a staple of Western music for over 200 years, and they continue to be used as a source of inspiration and creativity by composers, performers, and listeners alike.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
156,Piano,"Are ""upright pianos"" called ""vertical pianos""?","Yes, ""upright pianos"" are called ""vertical pianos"" because they have a compact and shorter action than traditional pianos.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
157,Piano,Did Bartolomeo Cristofori invent the modern piano?,"Bartolomeo Cristofori did not invent the modern piano. Cristofori was an early instrumentalist who invented the basic mechanical and technological principles of the piano, but it was not until a few years later, during the early 18th century, that a significant number of piano builders began to work on creating instruments with different features and functionalities. 

Gottfried Silbermann, a German organ builder, was a notable early inventor of the modern piano, and he was the first to incorporate the forerunner of the modern damper pedal into his pianos, which is still used today. Silbermann's innovative approach to piano design and his foresight in building instruments with different features and functionalities helped to revolutionize the piano industry and pave the way for the development of new types of piano, such as the harpsichord, the clavichord, and the pianoforte.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
158,Piano,What is the middle pedal called on grand pianos?,"The middle pedal on a grand piano is called the ""practice"" pedal, also known as the ""celeste"" pedal or the ""bass sustain"" pedal. It is a sostenuto pedal that drops a piece of felt between the hammers and strings, and greatly muting the sounds. The ""practice"" pedal is often used when a pianist needs to sustain a single bass note or chord over many measures, while playing the melody in the treble section. The ""celeste"" pedal and the ""bass sustain"" pedal are non-standard variants of the middle pedal on grand pianos.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
159,Piano,How many black keys do modern pianos have?,"Modern pianos have a total of 36 black keys, which is 7 less than the 52 white keys of a grand piano.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
160,Piano,What is the sustain pedal called?,"The sustain pedal is a pedal on a grand piano that is used to sustain a sound while the player's hands are free to play other notes. It is a sostenuto pedal, which means that it keeps a raised damper while the player's hands are free to play other notes. The sustain pedal is not the same as the soft pedal, which is a pedal that moves the hammers closer to the strings to produce a soft, muted sound. The sustain pedal is often found on the pedals of pianos that have a large number of keys, such as those used in concert halls or large public concerts.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1

163,Piano,Is the left-most pedal on a grand piano called the una corda?,"Yes, the left-most pedal on a grand piano is called the ""una corda"" pedal. It is a variation of the ""soft pedal"" and is used to change the overall tone of the piano. The una corda pedal is a more powerful and precise way to adjust the volume and tone of a grand piano compared to the soft pedal.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
164,Piano,Is it advantageous for a grand piano's metal plate to be quite massive?,"Yes, the metal plate of a grand piano is usually quite massive. This is because grand pianos are often played by musicians who require a large, powerful, and efficient sound system. The size and weight of the metal plate are crucial for supporting the weight of the strings and amplifiers that are used in playing grand pianos. The use of large, heavy metal plates in grand pianos helps to amplify the sound and create a powerful, rich, and resonant sound. This is important for the musician's performance, as it allows them to produce complex and expressive sounds. The use of cast iron, which is less massive and weaker, would not be practical or effective for the production of a grand piano.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
165,Piano,Is the mechanism in an upright piano perpendicular to its keys?,"No, the mechanism in an upright piano is not perpendicular to its keys. The keys are always parallel to the action, which is the mechanism that controls the hammer to string contact. The action is located on the front of the keyboard, which means that the keys are closest to the action and the hammer rests closest to the strings. This arrangement allows for greater control and accuracy in playing, but it also means that the action is higher up on the keyboard than in a studio piano or a console piano.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
166,Piano,About how tall is a typical studio piano?,"A typical studio piano is around 42 to 45 inches tall. However, the exact height can vary depending on the manufacturer and the specific model. The height of a studio piano is typically lower than the height of a standard upright piano. In some cases, the height of a studio piano may be slightly higher than a standard upright piano due to the additional height required for the piano's mechanism and the soundboard.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
167,Piano,What are a piano's keys generally made of?,"A piano's keys are generally made of spruce or basswood, for lightness. Spruce is normally used in high-quality pianos. Traditionally, the black keys were made from ebony and the white keys were covered with strips of ivory, but since ivory-yielding species are now endangered and protected by treaty, plastics are now almost exclusively used. Also, ivory tends to chip more easily than plastic. Legal ivory can still be obtained in limited quantities. At one time, the Yamaha firm innovated a plastic called ""Ivorine"" or ""Ivorite"", since imitated by other makers, that mimics the look and feel of ivory.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
168,Piano,How many total keys does a typical modern piano have?,"The typical modern piano has 36 black keys and 52 white keys for a total of 88 keys. However, some older pianos only have 85 keys (seven octaves from A0 to C8) while some manufacturers extend the range further in one or both directions. The extra keys are sometimes hidden under a small hinged lid that can be flipped down to cover the keys in order to avoid visual disorientation in a pianist unfamiliar with the extended keyboard. On some older models, the keys are hidden behind a small hinged lid that can be flipped down to expose the keys. The total number of keys on a piano depends on the manufacturer, model, and version, but generally, it ranges from 36 to 88.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
169,Piano,Why are upright pianos more compact?,"Upright pianos are more compact because they have a shorter height than their vertical counterparts. The height of a piano is determined by the dimensions of the piano's frame and the height of the top of the piano's keyboard. Upright pianos have a shorter height than studio pianos, which have a longer piano frame and higher top, making them easier to maneuver and store. Additionally, the shorter height of upright pianos allows for more space in the room for the player to move around. Therefore, the vertical action is more suitable for pianos with longer frames and higher tops, while upright pianos are more suitable for pianos with shorter frames and higher tops.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
170,Piano,Do older pianos have more keys than modern pianos?,"Yes, older pianos have more keys than modern pianos. The number of keys on a piano is generally greater because modern pianos have a smaller range than older pianos. Modern pianos typically have 88 keys, but older pianos have 68 or even fewer keys. This is because some older pianos only have 85 keys (seven octaves from A0 to A7), while some manufacturers extend the range further in one or both directions.

The reason why there are more keys on a modern piano is that the designers of the piano had to fit more keys onto a smaller space. In an earlier era, pianos had more keys, but that was because the size of the instrument required more keys to accommodate the limited space available. By contrast, modern pianos have a larger space to work with, and designers were able to fit more keys onto a smaller number of keys.

Modern pianos typically have more keys because they have a larger range, but the number of keys on a modern piano is still greater than on older pianos.","{'S09_set2_a1.txt.cl', 'S10_set2_a1.txt.cl'}",S10_set2_a1,1
